# Muon.jl: multimodal framework

`Muon.jl` provides functionality to work with multimodal datasets in Julia. It implements annotated data structures for unimodal and multimodal data and can be used together with the `muon` ecosystem across programming languages with data exchange via `.h5mu` files.

Muon.jl is part of the scverse® project ([website](https://scverse.org), [governance](https://scverse.org/about/roles)) and is fiscally sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).
If you like scverse® and want to support our mission, please consider making a tax-deductible [donation](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-scverse) to help the project pay for developer time, professional services, travel, workshops, and a variety of other needs.
